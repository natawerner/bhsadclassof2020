          <h1>We’ll see how it goes — Lesya Kuranova</h1>
          <p>This project focuses on coming up with assignments for designers. Despite the fact that a lot of exercises for art students are quite engaging and interesting, the presentation of them is not as unique. There is a tendency to present new briefs only with a typical slide-show and an A4 handout. The idea for this project is not only to invent new and exciting briefs for the students, but also to try and find relevant and engaging presentation for the assignments. The project could be considered a fun experimental research on educational system in art schools, where each assignment derives from author’s revelations, likes and personal experiences.
The project consists of 7 assignments for designers. Each assignment was created, tested and presented in about 2 weeks. When one brief was done, the work on the next one started immediately. The briefs differ in content, choice of targeted audience, scale and duration. But all of them share the fact that the participant (potential design student) is starting to experience, understand and relate to the project right from the briefing.</p>
<p>When it came to the presentation of all the materials that were accumulated and created throughout the project, Lesya struggled with finding the right format. All of the briefs were of different medium and form. Therefore, the website which gathered and explained everything, seemed like the most logical solution.<p>
          <h1><a href="https://lesyakuranova.com" target="_blank">Project website</a></h1>
          <p>The website not only gathers all of the files connected to each individual brief, but also has some external references and a vocal point – video where the project is reinterpreted and retold to Lesya’s family members. The video is compilation of short clips, where Lesya tries to explain each project to Russian-speaking non-designers (question like ‘so what?’ appears a lot).
The experience of explaining each project, getting people’s reactions and answering the questions turned out to be what seemed like a new assignment, but not for imaginary students, but for Lesya.<p>
