          <h1>Passing — Masha Andrianova</h1>
          <p>Passing project is the experience of overcoming nostalgia. An attempt to tribute the past. To thank the past, childhood and roots for guidance in life. To make its life continue in the present, in an altered form. Project final form is a personal calendar that uses shapes of foil seals to indicate time. These shapes are taken from monthly tickets from a small town on north-east of Russia called Cherepovets. This 'time tracking' technique, unlike numbers, create a unique composition for each day, week, and year.</p>
          <p>Each shape indicates a number from 0 to 31. Shapes starting from 10 create a new shape out of two ones that represent a number from 0 to 9. That makes 18, for example, a combination of shapes for 1 and 8. Pictures on the back of the Calendar are reinterpretations of 20 original tickets dated 2007–2011 and a tribute to their visual elements, which were changed a few years later. That goes alongside with thought and memories arranged in one text, which makes the Calendar to be a visual essay, a reflection on 18 years spent in hometown. These tickets have become a symbol of the period. And the project isn't only an exploration of the artefact, but the person.</p>
          <p>The Calendar consists of 62 sheets for 53 weeks from June 2020 to May 2021. Such duration was made intentionally as it's considered to be a personal life-cycle. Dates of a week go line by line with the first day always placed on the top left corner, and weekends on the last bottom line. Holidays and personal meaningful dates included are written on the frame according to a vertical shape position.</p>
