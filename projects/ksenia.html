          <h1>Oasis Of Offers — Gabueva Ksenia</h1>
          <p>The goal is to convey the feeling of owning the luxury products. It is not for everyone, it is limited, high qualified, so the location was chosen by this idea, the place is kind of uninhabited. In the centre of sand desert you find this oasis which becomes a treasure for dehydrated travelers - like customers who are looking for the best cosmetic products in a huge world of offers. Each product is independent and submitted individually it shows the ability of using them separately but still they are one collection that can be seen in the last frames. The scene is cycled and a camera literally comes back to the first view.</p>
          <p>From nothing to the finished products because every collection has a story behind, a lot of work and processes of manufacturing that is also demonstrated with product animations. The real products are presented in a surreal world, the idea is to create a story where the products exist, a fairy tale that attract customers to make a purchase and become a part of this world and the fabulous promotion. This experience of using luxury limited products is translated in each scene. Restraint color palette, calm music, exaggerated textures and materials are forced to evoke emotions and desire of owning the products.</p>
          <p>P.s. This project was made under quarantine on a seven year old MacBook Pro.<p>
